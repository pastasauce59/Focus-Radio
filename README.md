To get Focus Radio app up and running, locate it in your local directory then run npm install. Afterwards run npm start to run the application. 

When you arrive at the landing page you will have three choices to select your mental state and navigate to the audio player that with the corresponding music based on your chocie. At the audio player page you can navigate back home by selecting the home/re-focus button in the top right corner. 

The audio player will automatically play the first track in its playlist based on the mental state you chose. After it ends it will then proceed to the next track. Here is where I started to run into problems with the player - while it will load to the next track based on the handle function I created, you will notice the song title will change to next song but the player itself will not reload with the new audio. I wasn't able to find a proper solution around this without taking up more than 2 hours possibly to complete this. I have not worked with audio files in an application before so this turned out to be a bit tricky for me. Again due to the suggested time to complete this and not knowing a proper way to serve the audio files I imported them to public folder here. I decided to try and dynamically change them in the audio player by storing them in objects that reference to the assets folder's actually mp3 file and then importing the objects to app.js.
